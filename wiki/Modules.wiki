#summary JPublish modules

= What Is a Module? =

JPublish is extended through modules. Modules must implement the {{{org.jpublish.JPublishModule}}} interface. Modules do not actually handle every request which is passed to the JPublish system, rather it exposes actions which can be used wherever JPublish actions can be used.

*Writing Modules*

JPublish modules consist of a class which implements the {{{org.jpublish.JPublishModule}}} interface as well as one or more classes which implement the Action interface. Modules can be thought of as a collection of actions which are related. To deploy a module just include the module with its actions in the classpath. The easiest way to do this is to include everything in a single JAR file.
