= Introduction =

This page is about various ORM frameworks supported by JPublish.


=Cayenne=
Cayenne is a Java object relational mapping (ORM) framework. In other words, it is a tool for Java developers who need to talk to a database (or many databases). Rather than hardcoding SQL statements through Java code, Cayenne allows a programmer to work only with Java objects abstracted from the database. Cayenne is supported via a JPublish Module integration. For a complete description of Cayenne's features, please visit Cayenne's own [http://cayenne.apache.org/ site].
